# React App

The web app is only serve a front end part. It including 3 pages which are about me page, to do list maker page, and contact page. The app implement react hook usage that is useState (used in Contact page for data validation and To Do List Maker) and useEffect (used for make an alert). The web app also serevd in vercel app, that can be accessed with in <https://learn-react-kp.vercel.app/>. 

This is how I deploy my app into vercel via GitHub:
1. Sign up to the vercel web page <https://vercel.com/> with GitHub account.
2. Add project and configure to the repository with repository that contain the app and import it.
3. Setting up the app that will be deployed, such as framework that used (in my case I use "Vite"), the root of project repository, etc (in my case I only left the rest as default).
4. Click the deploy button, and the app successfully deployed.
